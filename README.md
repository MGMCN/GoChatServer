# ChatServer
When we learn a new programming language, we always end up making a chat system to show that we have mastered most of the grammar of the language. (This is just a joke. Ha ha ha. This chat system is based on the go language. In fact, this is just a learning note for me to learn the go language.)

# Some changes
I modified the code of chat in Chapter 8. There are some Chinese comments in the code. This is because it is convenient for me to study and understand. I modified the code to be able to enter the chat room user name, and the server will not send the message to the message sender again when forwarding the message.（In fact, this is the code I rewritten to learn goroutine. Hahaha!）
